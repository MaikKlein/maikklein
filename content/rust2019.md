# Custom allocator


```Rust
pub type ArenaVec<T> = Vec<T, ArenaAlloc>;
let v: ArenaVec<f32> = someiter.collect_alloc(arena_alloc.clone());
```

# impl trait inside traits

I often run into 

```Rust
trait Foo {
    fn items(&self) -> ???;
}
```

Most of the time I just want to return an `Iterator`, but I am too lazy to wrap it in a struct. It gets really annoying when to have to write boilerplate code all the time. Often I just return a `Vec<Items>` and call it a day. And if it is a performance problem, it should be trivially to fix later. `impl trait` would be really convenient for cases like this.

Note with custom allocators we can write code like this:

```Rust
trait Foo {
    fn items<A: Alloc>(&self) -> Vec<Items, A>;
}

foo.items::<Linear>();
```

And also avoid an allocation.


# Guidelines

Improved [guidelines](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/api-guidelines/) should be a major goal. It needs to be more ..

It should answer questions like:

* Should a function be unsafe, if it doesn't cause unsafety but it is very tricky to use and most likely results in a crash if not correctly?

* I have also seen libraries that have a safe **public** interface, but are actually **completely** unsafe. I wish this would be addressed in the guidelines.

We could also include common tricks, for example [Functions minimize assumptions about parameters by using generics (C-GENERIC)](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/api-guidelines/flexibility.html#functions-minimize-assumptions-about-parameters-by-using-generics-c-generic). 

You can run into code bloat with traits that have a many to one relationship, like `AsRef`, `Into` etc.

```Rust
fn foo<P: AsRef<Path>>(p: P){
    // Monomorphize the inner function to avoid code bloat
    fn inner(path: &Path){
        ...
    }
    inner(p.as_ref());
}
```

# Variadics
For [pyro](https://github.com/MaikKlein/pyro), a lot of my code looks like this:
```Rust
impl_append_components!(1  => A);
impl_append_components!(2  => A, B);
impl_append_components!(3  => A, B, C);
impl_append_components!(4  => A, B, C, D);
impl_append_components!(5  => A, B, C, D, E);
impl_append_components!(6  => A, B, C, D, E, F);
impl_append_components!(7  => A, B, C, D, E, F, G);
impl_append_components!(8  => A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H);
impl_append_components!(9  => A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I);
impl_append_components!(10 => A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J);
impl_append_components!(11 => A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K);
```

This is especially annoying when I have to create new idents, because you can't create new idents inside macros, which means you have to define them outside of the macro call. I wish
